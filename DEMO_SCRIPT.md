## Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **Speed:** Demo loan loads instantly, no upload needed
2. **Clarity:** Plain-English explanations, not jargon
3. **Actionability:** Not just alerts — tells you what to do
4. **Audit-ready:** Every action logged
5. **Risk reduction:** Catches issues before they become defaults

---

## Tips for Delivery

* **Speak at loan ops pace** (not tech conference pace)
* **Use their language:** "covenant breach," "technical default," "compliance certificate"
* **Pause after showing Issue Detail screen** — let them absorb the 4 sections
* **Invite questions at end** — they'll ask about their specific pain points
* **If demo breaks:** Fall back to static screenshots (prepare 3-4 key screens)

## Success Criteria

After 3 minutes, audience should understand:
✅ What LoanOps Copilot does (document intelligence + risk monitoring)  
✅ Who it's for (loan agents, lenders, credit teams)  
✅ Why it matters (prevent defaults, save time, reduce risk)  
✅ How it works (explainable, audit-ready, action-oriented)

**Next step:** Invite them to try the demo themselves or schedule a deeper dive.
