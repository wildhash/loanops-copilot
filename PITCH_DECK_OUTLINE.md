# LoanOps Copilot — Pitch Deck Outline

**8 Slides | Target: Loan market investors, lenders, agents**

---

## Slide 1: Problem

### Title: The Hidden Operational Risk in Syndicated Lending

**Visual:** Split screen showing overwhelmed loan officer vs. mountain of documents

**Key Points:**
* Syndicated loan agents manage **100+ active facilities** with thousands of pages of documents
* **Manual tracking** of covenants, reporting obligations, and term changes
* **High stakes:** A single missed covenant test can trigger $50M+ default
* **Common failures:**
  * Missed reporting deadlines (technical defaults)
  * Undetected document inconsistencies (billing disputes)
  * Late-spotted covenant breaches (relationship damage)

**Bottom Line (Large Text):**
> "Manual document review = Operational risk"

**Stats (if available):**
* 23% of loan defaults start with operational errors, not credit events
* Average loan agent spends 15+ hours/week on document review
* Covenant breach detection: 4-6 weeks too late (manual review)

## Slide 5: Efficiency Gains — Time & Cost Savings

### Title: ROI: Hours Saved, Risks Avoided

**Visual:** Before/After comparison table

| Task | Manual (Before) | With LoanOps Copilot (After) | Time Saved |
|------|----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Document review & term extraction | 2-4 hours | 5 minutes | **97%** |
| Covenant status check (per loan) | 30-45 min | Instant | **98%** |
| Version comparison for amendments | 1-2 hours | 2 minutes | **96%** |
| Upcoming deadline tracking | Spreadsheet (weekly) | Automated alerts | **100%** |
| **Total per loan per month** | **~10 hours** | **~30 minutes** | **95%** |

**Bottom Line:**
* **15 hours/week saved** for loan agent managing 50 loans
* **~$60K/year** in efficiency gains per agent (assuming $80/hr loaded cost)
* **Scale:** 10 agents = $600K/year savings

**Risk Avoidance:**
* **Prevent 1 technical default** = Save avg. $250K in legal/negotiation costs
* **Catch 1 billing dispute early** = Avoid $50K+ in adjustments

## Slide 6: Risk Reduction — Operational & Legal

### Title: Preventing the Costly Mistakes

**Visual:** 3 real-world scenarios

**Scenario 1: Missed Reporting Deadline**
* **Problem:** Compliance certificate submitted 2 days late
* **Result:** Technical default, default interest rate kicks in
* **Cost:** $25K additional interest over cure period
* **LoanOps Copilot:** Automated alert 7 days before deadline

**Scenario 2: Document Mismatch**
* **Problem:** Amendment changes margin from 250 to 325 bps, but billing system not updated
* **Result:** 6 months of incorrect invoicing, borrower dispute
* **Cost:** $75K adjustment + relationship damage
* **LoanOps Copilot:** Instant detection on document upload

**Scenario 3: Covenant Breach**
* **Problem:** Leverage ratio hits 3.05x (max 3.00x), detected 4 weeks after quarter-end
* **Result:** Scramble for waiver, rushed amendment negotiation
* **Cost:** $100K in legal fees, strained lender relationships
* **LoanOps Copilot:** Alert when ratio reaches 2.95x ("At Risk" status)

**Key Message:**
> "Operational risk isn't abstract. It's dollars and defaults. LoanOps Copilot catches issues early."

## Slide 8: Why Now & Next Steps

### Title: The Timing is Right

**Why Now:**

1. **Regulatory Pressure**
   * Increased scrutiny on operational risk (Basel III/IV)
   * Loan agents must demonstrate robust compliance monitoring

2. **Technology Readiness**
   * Document AI / NLP mature enough for production use
   * Desktop apps provide security for confidential docs

3. **Market Pain Point**
   * Post-2023 rate volatility = more covenant breaches
   * Agent banks struggling with staffing (aging workforce)
   * Cost pressure to do more with less

4. **Competitive Landscape**
   * Loan management systems (Finastra, FIS) focus on accounting, not intelligence
   * No direct competitor offering explainable, desktop-first covenant monitoring
   * **White space opportunity**

**Why Us:**
* **Domain expertise** in syndicated lending operations
* **Product-first approach** (demo-ready prototype, not vaporware)
* **Explainability focus** (critical for regulated industry)
* **Banker-friendly UX** (not overengineered fintech)
